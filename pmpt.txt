Goal:
Create, maintain, and improve a Blender 5.0+ add-on that can import Fritzing parts into Blender as usable 3D assets.

Key Requirements:
- Target Blender: 5.0+ (use current Blender Python API best practices).
- Language: Python, structured as a standard Blender add-on package.
- Add-on type: Import plugin listed under File > Import (e.g., "Fritzing Part (.fzp, .fzz)").
- Support platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux (no OS-specific logic unless necessary).

Fritzing Support:
- Input formats: .fzp (part definition), .fzz (full Fritzing project) if feasible.
- Use Fritzing part metadata to build a 3D representation suitable for electronics layouts.
- Parse and use available graphics (SVGs for PCB, breadboard, and schematic views) when useful.
- Map electrical connectors/pins to Blender objects or empties for later use in assemblies.

3D Model Generation:
- Generate clean, low-poly meshes for common part types (resistors, capacitors, ICs, headers, connectors, etc.).
- Preserve correct relative dimensions where possible, based on Fritzing metadata (e.g., pin spacing, body size).
- Organize imported parts into collections and name objects and materials clearly.
- Apply consistent scale: 1 Blender unit = 1 meter; Fritzing typically uses mm, so convert appropriately.

User Experience:
- Provide a simple import dialog (file selector with options like scale, level of detail, and axis orientation).
- Allow the user to choose which Fritzing view to base the import on (PCB view priority; breadboard as fallback).
- Expose basic options in the add-on preferences (default scale, default material style, naming conventions).

Code Quality:
- Follow PEP 8 and idiomatic Blender Python API usage.
- Use clear modular structure: operators, panels, IO/parsers, model generators, and utilities.
- Include registration boilerplate (bl_info, register/unregister) and ensure add-on installs and enables cleanly.
- Add concise docstrings and comments for non-obvious logic.

Search Instructions (#web #websearch):
- When needed, search the web for:
	- Latest Blender 5.0+ Python API for importers, file selector, and mesh creation.
	- Public documentation or examples of Fritzing .fzp/.fzz file structures and SVG asset usage.
	- Best practices for unit conversion and electronics modeling in Blender.

Task Style:
- Be concise and implementation-focused.
- Prefer working, minimal examples over theoretical explanations.
- When proposing code, ensure it can run inside Blender's scripting environment with minimal changes.
